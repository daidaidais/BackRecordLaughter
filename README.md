# LAUGHTER BACK RECORDER

Back records a 15 second video when laughter is detected to keep a record of the banal yet precious moments of stuff happening in your room.

The laugh detector is created by [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com)'s [genius data scientists](https://labs.ideo.com/2018/06/15/how-to-build-your-own-laugh-detector/). The laugh detection code itself is open source [here](https://github.com/ideo/LaughDetection).

An example of the output video

**There is a bug in the code that makes the audio of the output video approx. 1 second faster than the image. Will be fixed (soon).**
